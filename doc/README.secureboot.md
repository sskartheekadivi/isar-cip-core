# EFI Boot Guard secure boot

This document describes how to generate a secure boot capable image with
[efibootguard](https://github.com/siemens/efibootguard).

## Description

The image build signs the EFI Boot Guard bootloader (bootx64.efi) and generates
a signed [unified kernel image](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image).
A unified kernel image packs the kernel, initramfs and the kernel command-line
in one binary object. As the kernel command-line is immutable after the build
process, the previous selection of the root file system with a command-line parameter is no longer
possible. Therefore the selection of the root file-system occurs now in the initramfs.

The image uses an A/B partition layout to update the root file system. The sample implementation to
select the root file system generates a uuid and stores the id in /etc/os-release and in the initramfs.
During boot the initramfs compares its own uuid with the uuid stored in /etc/os-release of each rootfs.
If a match is found the rootfs is used for the boot.

## Adaptation for Images

### WIC
The following elements must be present in a wks file to create a secure boot capable image.

```
part --source efibootguard-efi  --sourceparams "signwith=<script or executable to sign the image>"
part --source efibootguard-boot --sourceparams "signwith=<script or executable to sign the image>"
```

#### Script or executable to sign the image

The wic plugins for the [bootloader](./scripts/lib/wic/plugins/source/efibootguard-efi.py)
and [boot partition](./scripts/lib/wic/plugins/source/efibootguard-boot.py) require an
executable or script with the following interface:
```
<script_name> <inputfile> <outputfile>
```
- script name: name and path of the script added with
`--sourceparams "signwith=/usr/bin/sign_secure_image.sh"` to the wic image
- inputfile: path and name of the file to be signed
- outputfile: path and name of the signed input

Supply the script name and path to wic by adding
`signwith=<path and name of the script to sign>"` to sourceparams of the partition.

### Existing key packages for signing an image

#### secure-boot-snakeoil

This package uses the snakeoil key and certificate from the ovmf package from
Debian trixie or later for signing the image.

#### secure-boot-key

This package takes a user-generated certificate and key adds them to the build system.
The following variable and steps are necessary to build a secure boot capable image:
- Set certification information to sign and verify the image with:
    - SB_CERT: The certificate to verify the signing process
    - SB_KEY: The private key of for the certificate

The files referred by SB_CERT and SB_KEY must be store in `recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files/`.

## Running in QEMU

Set up a secure boot test environment with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)

### Prerequisites

- OVMF from edk2 release 2025.02-8+deb13u1 or newer
  - This documentation was tested under Debian 13 with OVMF (2025.02-8+deb13u1) from Debian trixie
- efitools for KeyTool.efi
  - This documentation was tested under Debian 13 with efitools (1.9.2-3.5) from Debian trixie
- libnss3-tools

### Debian Snakeoil keys

The build copies the  Debian Snakeoil keys to the directory `./build/tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/OVMF.
You can use them as described in section [Start Image](#start-the-image).

### Generate Keys

#### Reuse existing keys

It is possible to use exiting keys like /usr/share/ovmf/PkKek-1-snakeoil.pem' from Debian
by executing the script  `scripts/generate-sb-db-from-existing-certificate.sh`, e.g.:
```
export SB_NAME=<name for the secureboot config>
export SB_KEYDIR=<location to store the database>
export INKEY=<secret key of the certificate>
export INCERT=<certificate>
export INNICK=<name of the certificate in the database>
scripts/generate-sb-db-from-existing-certificate.sh
```
This will create the directory `SB_KEYDIR` and will store the `${SB_NAME}certdb` with the given name.

Copy the used certificate and private key to `recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files/`

#### Generate keys

To generate the necessary keys and information to test secure-boot with QEMU
execute the script `scripts/generate_secure_boot_keys.sh`

##### Add Keys to OVMF
1. Create a folder and copy the generated keys and KeyTool.efi
(in Debian the file can be found at: /lib/efitools/x86_64-linux-gnu/KeyTool.efi) to the folder

```bash
mkdir secureboot-tools
cp -r keys secureboot-tools
cp /lib/efitools/x86_64-linux-gnu/KeyTool.efi secureboot-tools
```

2. Copy the file OVMF_VARS_4M.fd (in Debian the file can be found at /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd)
to the current directory. OVMF_VARS_4M.fd contains no keys can be instrumented for secureboot.
3. Start QEMU with the script scripts/start-efishell.sh

```bash
./scripts/start-efishell.sh secureboot-tools
```

4. Start the KeyTool.efi FS0:\KeyTool.efi and execute the the following steps:

```
          -> "Edit Keys"
             -> "The Allowed Signatures Database (db)"
                -> "Add New Key"
                -> Change/Confirm device
                -> Select "demoDB.esl" file
             -> "The Key Exchange Key Database (KEK)"
                -> "Add New Key"
                -> Change/Confirm device
                -> Select "demoKEK.esl" file
             -> "The Platform Key (PK)
                -> "Replace Key(s)"
                -> Change/Confirm device
                -> Select "demoPK.auth" file
```

5. quit QEMU

### Build image

Build the image with a signed EFI Boot Guard and unified kernel image
with the snakeoil keys by executing:

```bash
./kas-container build kas-cip.yml:kas/board/qemu-amd64.yml:kas/opt/trixie.yml:kas/opt/ebg-secure-boot-snakeoil.yml
```

For user-generated keys, create a new option file in the repository. This option file could look like this:

```yaml
header:
  version: 14
  includes:
   - kas/opt/ebg-swu.yml

local_conf_header:
  secure-boot-image: |
    IMAGE_FSTYPES = "wic"
    IMAGE_TYPEDEP:wic += "verity"
    SWU_ROOTFS_TYPE = "verity"
    WKS_FILE = "${MACHINE}-efibootguard-secureboot.wks.in"
    INITRAMFS_INSTALL:append = " initramfs-verity-hook"
    # abrootfs cannot be installed together with verity
    INITRAMFS_INSTALL:remove = "initramfs-abrootfs-hook"

  secure-boot: |
    IMAGER_BUILD_DEPS += "ebg-secure-boot-signer"
    IMAGER_INSTALL:wic += "ebg-secure-boot-signer"

    # Use user-generated keys
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_secure-boot-secrets = "secure-boot-key"

  secureboot_override: |
    OVERRIDES .= ":secureboot"

  user-keys: |
    SB_CERT = "demoDB.crt"
    SB_KEY = "demoDB.key"
```

Replace `demo` with the name of the user-generated certificates. The user-generated certificates
need to stored in the folder `recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files`.

Build the image with user-generated keys by executing the command:

```bash
./kas-container build kas-cip.yml:kas/board/qemu-amd64.yml:kas/opt/trixie.yml:<path to the new option>.yml
```

### Start the image

#### Debian snakeoil

Start the image with the following command:

```bash
DISTRO_RELEASE=trixie SECURE_BOOT=y \
./start-qemu.sh amd64
```
#### User-generated keys
Start the image with the following command:

```bash
DISTRO_RELEASE=trixie SECURE_BOOT=y \
OVMF_CODE=./build/tmp/deploy/images/qemu-amd64/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd \
OVMF_VARS=<path to the modified OVMF_VARS.fd> \
./start-qemu.sh amd64
```

After boot check the dmesg for secure boot status like below:

```bash
root@demo:~# dmesg | grep Secure
[    0.008368] Secure boot enabled
```

In case of arm64 or armhf architectures, the secure boot status can be found in bootloader logs like below:

```bash
EFI stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.
```
## Example: Update the image

For updating the image, the following steps are necessary:
- [Build the image with snakeoil keys](#build-image)
- save the generated swu `build/tmp/deploy/images/qemu-amd64/cip-core-image-cip-core-trixie-qemu-amd64.swu` to /tmp
- modify the image for example, switch to the RT kernel as modification:

```bash
./kas-container build kas-cip.yml:kas/board/qemu-amd64.yml:kas/opt/trixie.yml:kas/opt/ebg-secure-boot-snakeoil.yml:kas/opt/rt.yml
```

- start the new target

```bash
DISTRO_RELEASE=trixie SECURE_BOOT=y \
./start-qemu.sh amd64
```

Copy the swu cip-core-image-cip-core-trixie-qemu-amd64.swu to the running system

```bash
scp -P 22222 /tmp/cip-core-image-cip-core-trixie-qemu-amd64.swu root@127.0.0.1:/
```

- check which is the root partition and it should be `/dev/sda4`

```bash
root@demo:~# ls -l /sys/block/dm-0/slaves/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 30 12:56 sda4 -> ../../../../pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/ata6/host5/target5:0:0/5:0:0:0/block/sda/sda4
```

- install the swupdate and reboot the image

```bash
root@demo:~# swupdate -i cip-core-image-cip-core-trixie-qemu-amd64.swu
root@demo:~# reboot
```

- check which is the root partition now, the rootfs should have changed (i.e `/dev/sda5`):

```bash
root@demo:~# ls -l /sys/block/dm-0/slaves/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 30 13:20 sda5 -> ../../../../pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/ata6/host5/target5:0:0/5:0:0:0/block/sda/sda5
```

## Secure boot on Generic UEFI x86

Secureboot for a generic UEFI x86 target works similar to the QEMU target,
except the enrollment of the secure boot keys.

### Generate keys from Debian snakeoil keys

For testing purposes, the snakeoil keys from OVMF package can be used to
convert the certificate into a efi authority file use the following commands:

```bash
cert-to-efi-sig-list recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files/bookworm/PkKek-1-snakeoil.pem PK.esl
sign-efi-sig-list -k recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files/bookworm/PkKek-1-snakeoil.key -c recipes-devtools/secure-boot-secrets/files/bookworm/PkKek-1-snakeoil.pem PK PK.esl PK.auth
```

The package `efitools` needs to be installed for this.

In this case, the PK.esl can be used as DB and KEK keys. The PK.auth file is for PK key.

### Secure boot key enrollment

> :exclamation:**IMPORTANT** This document is not for generating a Machine Owner Key(MOK).

> :exclamation:**IMPORTANT** Enrollment of secure boot keys must occur
> in a secure environment.

The following keys need to be enrolled onto the device:
 - The Platform Key (PK)
 - The Key Exchange Key (KEK)
 - Allowed Signatures Database

The enrollment can typically be achieved with the help of
[efi-updatevar](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/efitools/efi-updatevar.1.en.html)
on the device.

If the device supports built in EFI shell then the enrollment of keys can also be done by KeyTool.efi tool like below:

Format the USB memory stick

```
host$ sudo mkfs.vfat <usb device>
host$ sudo mount -t vfat /dev/<usb device> /mnt/
```

Copy the KeyTool.efi binary and self signed Secure Boot keys to USB stick

Here the folder "keys" contains Secure Boot keys(DB, KEK and PK).
```
host$ sudo apt install efitools
host$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efi/boot
host$ sudo cp /usr/lib/efitools/x86_64-linux-gnu/KeyTool.efi /mnt/efi/boot/KeyTool.efi
host$ sudo cp -r keys /mnt/
host$ sudo umount /mnt
```
Launch KeyTool.efi binary from the built in EFI shell and follow step-4 from the section [Add Keys to OVMF](#add-keys-to-ovmf) to inject Secure Boot keys. Otherwise, consult the manual of the specific UEFI Firmware.

Use the recipes [secure-boot-key](###secure-boot-key) to provided the keys
to the signing script contained in
[ebg-secure-boot-signer](###ebg-secure-boot-signer).

### [ebg-secure-boot-signer](./recipes-devtools/ebg-secure-boot-signer/ebg-secure-boot-signer_0.2.bb)

During building a efibootguard based wic image the scripts contained in
the recipe ebg-secure-boot-signer can be used to sign the bootloader and
unified kernel image(UKI). If the keys are stored in a HSM the script can
be exchanged to sign the artifacts in a more secure way.
